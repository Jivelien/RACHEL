# RACHEL
Replicate All Controller from Home Emitting Light
 
## Problem statement
Many apparels are controlled by an infra-red remote controller. It's commun to have trouble with those remote... Loosing them, breaking them, no more batteries ...

When it's happen, there are very few reliable solutions. 
* You can try to buy a new one, but for old apparels it can be difficult to find.
* You can move you a** from the sofa but uh... nobody want to do that. 

Moreover, sometimes there is not even manual control option.

## Solution
RACHEL will basically clone remote controller.
- [ ] Clone signal
- [ ] Stock signal somewhere
- [ ] Emit signal

## Good to have
- [ ] Routine for multiple signal emission
- [ ] Custom receiver control
